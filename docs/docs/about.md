### Name meaning

The name comes from a Thai phrase [เอาไว้](https://www.thai2english.com/dictionary/1457374.html) which means "to keep/save/store for later".

A fun fact is that only after creating a repository and reserving NPM package name, it was realized that it is also a prefix of `await` keyword.
