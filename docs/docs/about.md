# About

Dependency-free state management library written in TypeScript.

This library suggests a unique [architectural approach](/architecture), where every event is a re-resolvable promise-like [AwaiEvent](/awai-event) with no terminal state.

It provides variety of utils helping to write declarative and well-structured code.

```bash title="Installation"
npm install awai
```

### Integrations

- **React** - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/awai-react), [Repository](https://github.com/yuriyyakym/awai-react)


### Name meaning

The name comes from a Thai phrase [เอาไว้](https://www.thai2english.com/dictionary/1457374.html) which means "to keep/save/store for later".

A fun fact is that only after creating a repository and reserving NPM package name, it was realized that it is also a prefix of `await` keyword.
