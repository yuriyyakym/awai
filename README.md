## About

Full-featured state management library, which suggests a unique [architectural approach](https://awai.store/architecture), where every event is a re-resolvable promise-like [AwaiEvent](https://awai.store/awai-event) with no terminal state.

Every Awai node has its events, which can be mixed into any async logics, or used as trigger for [Scenarios](https://awai.store/scenario).

For better understanding have a look at [documentation](https://awai.store) and [examples](https://awai.store/examples).
