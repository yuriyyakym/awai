# About

Dependency-free state management library written in TypeScript.

This library suggests unique [architectural approach](/architecture) which is based on the concept of promise-like [re-resolvable](/re-resolvable) objects.

```bash title="Installation"
npm install awai
```

### Name meaning

The name comes from a Thai phrase [เอาไว้](https://www.thai2english.com/dictionary/1457374.html) which means "to keep/save/store for later". You can listen to how native speaker pronounces it [here](https://youtu.be/hBee0WPvKUg?si=FGu374Ih-m9Ffwur&t=17).

A fun fact is that only after creating a repository and reserving NPM package name, I have realized that it is also a prefix of `await` keyword.
